 * Reads `AGENT_SIGNER_SECRET` from the environment at call time (never at module

 * absent). Used by `/api/agent` and `/api/authorize`.
 *
 *   - AGENT keypair: the backend's restricted External ed25519 policy signer.
 *     Its raw public key is the External signer the UI installs as the agent
 *     rule, and the same key the agent loop signs supplies with.
 *
 *   - DEMO OWNER keypair: a deterministic key derived from the agent secret
 *     (`ed25519Seed = sha256("yieldseeker-demo-owner:v1|" + AGENT_SIGNER_SECRET)`).
 *     It is the Default-rule OWNER of every demo-onboarded smart account, so the
 *     backend can produce the OZ SmartAccount AuthPayload owner signature for
 *     `add_context_rule` (step 2) that Freighter cannot. This is NEVER a real
 *     user secret — it is a deterministic, server-side demo signer.
